# Transformer Italian to English Translator

## Overview

This project implements a Transformer architecture for translating Italian sentences into English. The Transformer model is a deep learning architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., offering state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks. It leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture dependencies between words in an input sentence, enabling effective translation.

## Project Structure

The project comprises the following main components:

1. **Transformer Architecture Implementation**: The core functionality of the Transformer model is implemented in PyTorch. This includes modules for input embeddings, positional encodings, multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, encoder and decoder blocks, and the overall Transformer model. These components work together to encode input sentences and decode them into target language sentences.

2. **Data Processing**: Robust data processing functions are provided to handle bilingual datasets effectively. This involves loading and preprocessing datasets, tokenizing text data, and creating PyTorch DataLoader objects for efficient training and validation.

3. **Training Loop**: The training loop orchestrates the training process for the Transformer model. It utilizes PyTorch's optimizer and loss functions to optimize the model parameters over multiple epochs. During training, the model learns to generate accurate translations by minimizing the defined loss function.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Post-training, the model can be evaluated using provided evaluation functions. This involves generating translations for input sentences from a validation dataset and calculating evaluation metrics such as BLEU score or translation accuracy. Evaluation helps assess the quality of translations produced by the trained model.

## Usage

To use this project effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary dependencies like PyTorch, datasets, tokenizers, and tqdm. These dependencies enable seamless execution of the project's codebase.

2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your bilingual dataset for training. Ensure that the data is formatted correctly and split into training and validation sets. High-quality, well-annotated data is essential for training a robust translation model.

3. **Configuration**: Adjust the configuration parameters in the provided configuration file according to your dataset and training preferences. These parameters include batch size, number of epochs, learning rate, maximum sequence length, etc. Fine-tuning these parameters can significantly impact model performance.

4. **Training**: Execute the training script to train the Transformer model on your dataset. Monitor the training progress as it logs various metrics such as loss and validation accuracy. The model's weights will be periodically saved during training for future use.

5. **Evaluation**: Post-training, evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation functions. Load the trained model weights and pass validation data through the model to generate translations. Compare the generated translations with ground truth translations to assess model performance.

## Configuration Parameters

- `batch_size`: Batch size used during training. It determines the number of samples processed in each iteration.
- `num_epochs`: Number of epochs for training. An epoch represents one complete pass through the entire training dataset.
- `lr`: Learning rate for the optimizer. It controls the step size during gradient descent and influences how quickly the model learns.
- `seq_len`: Maximum sequence length for input and output sentences. Longer sequences may require more memory and computation.
- `d_model`: Dimensionality of model layers. It determines the size of the hidden representations within the Transformer model.
- `lang_src`: Source language (Italian in this case). Ensure consistency with your dataset.
- `lang_tgt`: Target language (English in this case). Ensure consistency with your dataset.
- `model_folder`: Directory to save trained model weights. Organize your experiments by storing models in separate folders.
- `preload`: Optionally preload a pre-trained model. Useful for transfer learning or resuming training from a specific checkpoint.
- `tokenizer_file`: File to save/load tokenizers. Tokenizers are essential for converting text data into numerical representations.
- `experiment_name`: Name of the experiment for logging. Helps differentiate between different training runs and experiments.
